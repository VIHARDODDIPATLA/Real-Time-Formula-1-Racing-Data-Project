# 🏎️ Real-Time Formula 1 Racing Data Project

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering pipeline that ingests, processes, stores, and analyzes real-time Formula 1 racing data using the Azure Data Engineering stack. The solution is designed with scalability, governance, and performance in mind, leveraging key technologies such as Azure Databricks, Delta Lake, Azure Data Factory, and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Real-time Data Ingestion**: Collect and stream Formula 1 racing telemetry and timing data.
- **Distributed Data Processing**: Use PySpark and Spark SQL within Azure Databricks for fast, scalable data transformations.
- **Delta Lake Storage**: Efficient data storage with ACID transactions and schema evolution support.
- **Data Governance & Security**: Enforce access controls and data lineage with Unity Catalog.
- **Orchestrated Pipelines**: Automate data flows using Azure Data Factory.
- **Insights & Analytics**: Produce real-time dashboards and analytics from processed racing data.

## ⚙️ Setup & Deployment

### 1. Provision Azure Resources

- Create an **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2** account.
- Set up an **Azure Databricks** workspace.
- Enable and configure **Unity Catalog** for governance.

### 2. Ingest Formula 1 Data

- Use **Azure Data Factory** pipelines to ingest raw data from public APIs or streaming sources.
- Store raw data in a **bronze** layer within ADLS Gen2.

### 3. Data Processing in Databricks

- Use **PySpark** notebooks to:
  - Read raw data.
  - Clean and transform telemetry and event data.
  - Store cleaned data in **Delta format** in the **silver** layer.
  - Aggregate data for analytics and store in a **gold** layer.

### 4. Register Data with Unity Catalog

- Create catalogs, schemas, and tables.
- Set permissions for secure data access by teams and roles.

### 5. Reporting and Visualization

- Connect **Power BI**, **Azure Synapse**, or other BI tools to Delta tables for live dashboards.
- Example metrics:
  - Lap time distribution
  - Pit stop efficiency
  - Driver vs team performance

---

## 📊 Example Use Cases

- **Performance Analytics**: Monitor driver performance lap-by-lap.
- **Strategy Analysis**: Analyze pit stop timing and effectiveness.
- **Historical Trends**: Track seasonal performance of teams and drivers.
- **Predictive Insights**: Use telemetry to forecast race outcomes.

---

## 🔐 Security & Compliance

- **Unity Catalog** ensures centralized access control and audit logs.
- Fine-grained permissions across catalogs, schemas, and tables.
- Supports data masking and classification for compliance requirements.

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Integrate **MLflow** for predictive modeling.
- Use **Event Hubs** or **Kafka** for live streaming ingestion.
- Deploy CI/CD with **Azure DevOps** or **GitHub Actions**.
- Create real-time dashboards in **Power BI Embedded**.
